*Dorsal Wing* is an innovative bus shelter on Druitt Street in Sydney’s CBD. Inspired by the aerodynamics of flight and the dark, planar wings of the stealth bomber, the stainless steel structure appears to float above the hordes of commuters.

>The internal structure comprises of a complex network of bespoke **stainless steel** sections and is clad with patinated stainless steel sheets.

Support for the shelter is provided by three slender stainless steel hangers that are chemically anchored into the adjacent reinforced concrete building, Town Hall House. The shelter is nestled around two existing trees, the positing of which drove the architectural and structural design.
