The design of the stairs at the Samsung building necessitated a finite element analysis of a free spanning *spiral staircase*. In order to keep a thin profile and not have any intermediate supports, the **curved balustrades act as deep beams** and provide stiffness to the staircase.

>A harmonic analysis was undertaken to ensure that vibrations and accelerations were within acceptable limits for a number of different loading scenarios.

The fixing into the existing concrete structure proved to be quite tricky as the stiffness gained from having semi-rigid supports was vital to the serviceability of the staircase.
